        <p><h2><center><strong>ABOUT US</strong></center></h2><br>

          We often dull ourselves into complacency with the way things are.
       While growing up there's an idea that is induced into our brains that the world is something that happens right outside your peepers and you just try to find your place and fit in while you see some other 'bright' people running it.
       When you start interacting with some of these people you learn that they're not very different from you. They might have a little more judgement in some areas but they're basically the same.
       There's something beyond what is going on in this life, something beyond a house, a car and a set monotous lifestyle that a human being is dulled into. There is another side to this coin and youll see that the moment you realise that if you push something here, another thing pops out on the other side. So be a round peg in a square hole. That way youve got a lot of room to fill in with something that is different.
       When you work on something, dont think about the non ideal consequences, let the idealism drive you. The non ideal consequences only play one role and that is to balance each other out. There's a reason why seeking idealism is the goal.
       It doesnt matter if you're taking a step a day, you'll still be farther from if you thought for days and took the same step.
<br>
       As Bob Dylan rightly said<br>
       "The chance wont come again,<br>
       and dont speak too soon<br>
       For the wheels still in spin'<br>
       and there's no tellin who that its namin'<br>
       For the loser now will be later to win<br>
       For the times they are a-changin"

<br><br><b><strong>Our mission</strong></b><br>
The prime objective of our club is to provide a learning platform where we can spread technical knowledge. We plan not only to participate in events and competitions but also belive in passing technical knowledge to all interested people who are passionate about electronics.

<br><br><b><strong>What we do</strong></b><br>
Robotics is budding technical field, we introduce it to new students and try to peek up their interest in this field.
We also conduct technical sessions to provide hands on practical knowledge to all interested people. Also, we form teams to participate in inter college robotics competitions.
